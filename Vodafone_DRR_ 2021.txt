Remuneration Committee

Letter from the Remuneration
Committee Chairman
On behalf of the Board, I present our 2021 Directors’
Remuneration Report.
This report includes both our Policy Report (as approved by shareholders
at the 2020 AGM), and our 2021 Annual Report on Remuneration, which
sets out how our policy was implemented during the year under review,
and how it will be applied for the year ahead.

Response to COVID-19
The last year has been a challenging period for our colleagues, customers,
and the societies in which we operate.
During this period our business has shown a high degree of resilience and
has continued to provide vital services at a time when communication
and connectivity is proving to be more important than ever both in our
personal and professional lives.
This resilience is illustrated through how our operations have continued
to function without needing to take the type of decisions that have been
necessary in other industries and businesses. For example, we have not
furloughed any of our employees and have continued our all-employee
global reward review in both 2020 and 2021, including the delivery of
performance related pay in line with our normal approach. We have also
continued to pay a dividend throughout this period.
Such actions formed part of the Committee’s consideration when
determining a number of matters in the year including executive salaries,
incentive outcomes, and package structures for the year ahead. The
Committee has also continued to work within the spirit of its principles
which aim to ensure our pay arrangements drive the behaviours critical
to the delivery of our strategy, are aligned with performance, encourage
shareholder alignment, and support our Fair Pay principles. Further details
of the Committee’s principles can be found online as part of our new
digital content using the link on this page.
The remainder of this letter and report provides further information on
the nature of and reasons for such decisions.

Stakeholder engagement during the year
As set out in last year’s letter, we launched our remuneration policy
consultation with our largest shareholders in November 2019 and the
Committee would like to thank all shareholders who took the time to
provide feedback during the period leading up to the shareholder vote
at our 2020 AGM. Our Policy Report was approved by over 96% of
shareholders, reflecting the importance and effectiveness of genuine
two-way dialogue during such consultations. The intention continues to
be for the current Policy Report to remain in place for its full three-year
regulatory life-cycle.
In terms of engaging the employee voice, whilst COVID-19 prevented
our European and South African employee forums from meeting
face-to-face, both were able to take place online. As Senior Independent
Director I attended one meeting with each forum, with feedback from
the meetings subsequently reported back directly to the Board. The
key topics raised by employee representatives this year focused on our
response to COVID-19 including matters of remote working, employee
well-being and communication during the period. I would like to thank
the representatives from both forums for inviting me and demonstrating
enthusiasm and diligence in our discussions.

and Chair of the Remuneration Committee explain her

When looking at the feedback from these forums and our other
channels of engagement (including senior leader ‘town hall’ webinars/
Q&A sessions, regular pulse surveys, and engagement through our digital
collaboration platforms) it is clear that our colleagues valued the open
and regular updates the business had given throughout the year in
respect of our response to COVID-19. Colleagues have also expressed
their pride in working for Vodafone during a period when our services
have proved critical to so many areas of society.
Further details on our stakeholder engagement activities can be found
on pages 12 and 13 of this Annual Report.

Arrangements for 2022
Base salary and pension arrangements
Neither the Chief Executive nor the Chief Financial Officer have received
a salary increase since their appointment to their current roles in 2018.
In light of their strong performance and growing experience in role,
the Committee agreed an increase would be justified. However, in line
with the restraint on salary increases for the wider leadership team, the
Committee felt that salaries for both Executive Directors should remain
unchanged for the year ahead. The Committee acknowledges the
importance of our arrangements remaining fair and competitive
and will review this situation again next year.
Pension arrangements for both Executive Directors will continue to
remain aligned with the wider UK workforce at 10% of base salary.
Annual bonus (‘GSTIP’)
Given the importance of growth to our strategy, the Committee agreed it
was appropriate to re-introduce service revenue as a performance measure
for the 2022 short-term incentive. As set out in last year’s report this
measure had been removed from the 2021 plan due to the difficulty in
setting an appropriate target given the uncertainty caused by COVID-19
at the time.
In light of the evolving external circumstances and our renewed
confidence in being able to set a robust target for 2022 it was agreed
this measure should be restored in the 2022 plan with a weighting of
25%. The remaining measures of free cash flow, EBIT, and customer
appreciation KPIs which have been retained from the 2021 structure,
will also be equally weighted at 25% for the 2022 plan.
Global long-term incentive (‘GLTI’)
Following the approval of the Policy Report at our 2020 AGM, the first
grant under our new GLTI structure which incorporates an ESG measure
was made in November 2020. For 2022 the intention is to keep the same
structure in line with our agreed normal policy. The intention is for such
awards to be made in August 2021 with the Committee reviewing both
internal and external considerations prior to formally approving the
awards at the July 2021 meeting. Further details can be found on
pages 101 and 102.

Performance outcomes during 2021
GSTIP performance (1 April 2020 – 31 March 2021)
Annual bonus performance during the year was measured against both
financial and strategic measures. Due to the difficulty in setting a service
revenue target in light of the uncertainty created by COVID-19 at the start
of the financial year the financial measures were adjusted free cash flow
and adjusted EBIT whilst the strategic measure was assessed against
customer appreciation KPIs. All three measures were equally weighted
at 1/3 of total bonus opportunity.
Performance under both of the financial measures and the strategic
measure was above the mid-point of the target range. The combined
performance resulted in an overall bonus payout of 62.0% of maximum.
Further details on performance can be found on pages 91 and 92.
GLTI performance (1 April 2018 – 31 March 2021)
The 2019 GLTI award (granted June 2018) was subject to free cash flow
(2/3 of total award) and relative TSR (1/3 of total award) performance.
Both performance conditions were measured over the three-year period
ending 31 March 2021.
Final FCF performance finished below the mid-point of the target range
resulting in 33.6% of the FCF element vesting. TSR performance was
below the median of the peer group resulting in no vesting under this
element. This resulted in an overall vesting percentage of 22.4% of
maximum. Further details of this vesting calculation can be found on
pages 92 and 93.

Consideration of discretion
The Committee reviewed the outcomes of both the annual bonus
and long-term incentive plan and considered the results both against
the relevant performance targets and the wider internal and external
context. As set out at the start of this letter, it was noted that the business
had remained resilient during the pandemic and that the bonus outcome
for the year reflected this. The Committee also agreed that the outcome
under the long-term incentive was appropriate given performance against
the three-year targets, particularly noting that the TSR element would
lapse in full. The Committee therefore concluded discretion was not
required. Further details can be found on page 91.

Looking forward
Renee James will be stepping down from the Board at the 2021 AGM.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Renee for her service to
both this Committee and the wider Board.
This year has once again been one of disruption and adaptation as our
colleagues, customers and societies have dealt with the developing
COVID-19 pandemic. Our people and business alike have shown resilience
and strength in the face of these challenges and it is this dedication and
commitment which will enable the next stage of our transformation
towards becoming the new generation connectivity and digital services
provider for Europe and Africa.
The rest of this report sets out both our Policy Report, as approved at
the 2020 AGM, and our Annual Report on Remuneration which sets out
the decisions and outcomes summarised in this letter in further detail.

Remuneration Policy
Remuneration Policy – notes to reader
No changes have been made to our policy since its approval at the 2020 Annual General Meeting which was held on 28 July 2020. Our approved
Policy Report is available on our website at vodafone.com, and has been reproduced below in the shaded boxes exactly as it was set out in the
2020 Annual Report. As such, some of the policy wording is now out of date; this includes references to the 2020 Annual General Meeting and
page number references.

Remuneration Policy
In this forward-looking section we describe our Remuneration Policy for the Board. This includes our considerations when determining policy,
a description of the elements of the reward package, including an indication of the potential future value of this package for each of the
Executive Directors, and the policy applied to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors.
We will be seeking shareholder approval for our Remuneration Policy at the 2020 AGM and we intend to implement it at that point. A summary
and explanation of the proposed changes to the current Remuneration Policy is provided on page 100. Subject to approval, we will review our
policy each year to ensure that it continues to support our company strategy and if it is necessary to make a change to our policy within the next
three years, we will seek shareholder approval.
Considerations when determining our Remuneration Policy
Our remuneration principles which are outlined on page 97 guide the Remuneration Committee when making decisions on our policy and its
implementation. A critical consideration for the Remuneration Committee when determining our Remuneration Policy is to ensure that it supports
our company purpose, strategy, and business objectives.
A variety of stakeholder views are taken into account when determining executive pay, including those of our shareholders, colleagues, and
external bodies. Further details on how we engage with, and consider the views of, each of these stakeholders are set out on page 115.
In advance of submitting our policy for shareholder approval we ran a thorough consultation exercise with our major shareholders. We invited
our top 20 shareholders and a number of key governance stakeholders to comment on remuneration at Vodafone and to provide feedback
on the proposed changes to the current policy which was approved at the 2017 AGM. A number of meetings between shareholders and the
Remuneration Committee Chairman took place during this consultation period. Further details of this consultation are provided on pages 97
and 98 whilst a summary of the proposed changes to our current policy, which are incorporated in this revised Remuneration Policy report,
is provided on page 100.
Listening to and consulting with our employees is very important and the Committee is supportive of the growing focus on engaging the
employee voice, which has accompanied recent changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code. Our engagement with colleagues can take
different forms in different markets but includes a variety of channels and approaches including our annual people survey which attracts very
high levels of participation and engagement, regular business leader Q&A sessions, and a number of internal digital communication platforms.
Our Senior Independent Director also undertakes an annual attendance at our European employee forum, and a similar body in South Africa,
with any questions or concerns raised by the employee representatives fed back directly to the Board for consideration and discussion.
We do not formally consult directly with employees on the executive Remuneration Policy nor is any fixed remuneration comparison
measurement used. However, when determining the policy for Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee is briefed on pay and
employment conditions of employees in Vodafone Group as a whole, with particular reference to the market in which the executive is based.
Further information on our approach to remuneration for other employees is given on page 105.
Performance measures and targets
Our Company strategy and business objectives are the primary consideration when we are selecting performance measures for our incentive
plans. The targets within our incentive plans that are related to internal financial measures (such as revenue, profit and cash flow) are typically
determined based on our budgets. Targets for strategic and external measures (such as customer appreciation KPIs, ESG measures, and total
shareholder return (‘TSR’)) are set based on company objectives and in light of the competitive marketplace. The threshold and maximum levels
of performance are set to reflect minimum acceptable levels at threshold and very stretching levels at maximum.
As in previous Remuneration Reports we will disclose the details of our performance targets for our short and long-term incentive plans. However,
our annual bonus targets are commercially sensitive and therefore we will only disclose our targets in the Remuneration Report following the
completion of the financial year. We will normally disclose the targets for each long-term award in the Remuneration Report for the financial year
preceding the start of the performance period – where this is not possible, such targets will be disclosed at the time of grant and published in the
next Remuneration Report.
At the end of each performance period we review performance against the targets, using judgement to account for items such as (but not limited
to) mergers, acquisitions, disposals, foreign exchange rate movements, changes in accounting treatment, material one-off tax settlements etc.
The application of judgement is important to ensure that the final assessments of performance are fair and appropriate.

Malus and clawback
In addition, the Remuneration Committee reviews the incentive plan results before any payments are made to executives or any shares vest and
has full discretion to adjust the final payment or vesting downwards if they believe circumstances warrant it. In particular, the Committee has the
discretion to use either malus or clawback as it sees appropriate. In the case of malus, the award may lapse wholly or in part, may vest to a lesser
extent than it would otherwise have vested or vesting may be delayed.
In the case of clawback, the Committee may recover bonus amounts that have been paid up to three years after the relevant payment date,
or recover share awards that have vested up to five years after the relevant grant date. The key trigger events for the use of the clawback
arrangements include material misstatement of performance, material miscalculation of performance condition outcomes, gross misconduct,
and reputational damage.
Subject to approval of this Remuneration Policy, these arrangements will be applicable to all bonus amounts paid, or share awards granted,
following the 2020 AGM. The current clawback arrangements, which are set out in the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the
2017 AGM, have been applicable to all bonus amounts paid, or share awards granted, since the 2017 AGM.

The Remuneration Policy table
The table below summarises the main components of the reward package for Executive Directors.
Fixed pay: Base salary
Purpose and link
to strategy

To attract and retain the best talent

Operation

Salaries are usually reviewed annually and fixed for 12 months commencing 1 July. Decision is influenced by:
–
–
–
–

level of skill, experience and scope of responsibilities of individual;
business performance, scarcity of talent, economic climate and market conditions;
increases elsewhere within the Group; and
external comparator groups (which are used for reference purposes only) made up of companies of similar size
and complexity to Vodafone.

Opportunity

Average salary increases for existing Executive Committee members (including Executive Directors) will not normally
exceed average increases for employees in other appropriate parts of the Group. Increases above this level may be
made in specific situations. These situations could include (but are not limited to) internal promotions, changes to role,
material changes to the business and exceptional company performance.

Performance metrics

None.

Fixed pay: Pension
Purpose and link
to strategy

To remain competitive within the marketplace

Operation

– Executive Directors may choose to participate in the defined contribution pension scheme or to receive a cash
allowance in lieu of pension.

Opportunity

– The pension contribution or cash payment is equal to the maximum employer contribution available to our UK
employees under our Defined Contribution scheme (currently 10% of annual gross salary).

Performance metrics

None.

Fixed pay: Benefits
Purpose and link
to strategy

To aid retention and remain competitive within the marketplace

Operation

– Travel related benefits. This may include (but is not limited to) company car or cash allowance, fuel and access to a
driver where appropriate.
– Private medical, death and disability insurance and annual health checks.
– In the event that we ask an individual to relocate we would offer them support in line with Vodafone’s relocation or
international assignment policies. This may cover (but is not limited to) relocation, cost of living allowance, housing,
home leave, education support, tax equalisation and advice.
– Legal fees if appropriate.
– Other benefits are also offered in line with the benefits offered to other employees, for example, our all-employee
share plan, mobile phone discounts, maternity/paternity benefits, sick leave, paid holiday, etc.

Opportunity

– Benefits will be provided in line with appropriate levels indicated by local market practice in the country of employment.
– We expect to maintain benefits at the current level but the value of benefit may fluctuate depending on, amongst
other things, personal situation, insurance premiums and other external factors.

Performance metrics

None.

Remuneration Policy (continued)
Annual bonus – Global Short-Term Incentive Plan (‘GSTIP’)
Purpose and link
to strategy

To drive behaviour and communicate the key priorities for the year.
To motivate employees and incentivise delivery of performance over the one year operating cycle.
The financial metrics drive our growth strategies whilst also focusing on improving operating efficiencies.
The strategic measures aim to ensure a great customer experience remains at the heart of what we do.

Operation

– Bonus levels and the appropriateness of measures and weightings are reviewed annually to ensure they continue to
support our strategy.
– Performance over the financial year is measured against stretching financial and non-financial performance targets
set at the start of the financial year.
– The annual bonus is usually paid in cash in June each year for performance over the previous year. A mandatory
deferral of 25% of post-tax bonus earned into shares for two years will normally apply except where an executive has
met or exceeded their share ownership requirement.

Opportunity

– Bonuses can range from 0–200% of base salary, with 100% paid for on-target performance. Maximum is only paid
out for exceptional performance.

Performance metrics

– Performance over each financial year is measured against stretching targets set at the beginning of the year.
– The performance measures normally comprise a mix of financial and strategic measures. Financial measures may
include (but are not limited to) profit, revenue and cash flow with a weighting of no less than 50%. Strategic measures
may include (but are not limited to) customer appreciation KPIs such as churn, revenue market share, and NPS.

Long-term incentive – Global Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘GLTI’)
Purpose and link
to strategy

To motivate and incentivise delivery of sustained performance over the long term.
To support and encourage greater shareholder alignment through a high level of personal
share ownership.
The use of free cash flow as the principal performance measure ensures we apply prudent cash
management and rigorous capital discipline to our investment decisions.
The use of TSR along with a performance period of not less than three years means that we are focused
on the long-term interests of our shareholders.

Operation

– Award levels and the framework for determining vesting are reviewed annually.
– Long-term incentive awards consist of shares subject to performance conditions which are granted each year.
– Awards will normally vest not less than three years after the respective award grant date based on Group
performance against the performance metrics set out below. In exceptional circumstances, such as but not limited
to where a delay to the grant date is required, the Committee may set a vesting period of less than three years,
although awards will continue to be subject to a performance period of at least three years.
– All post-tax shares are subject to a mandatory two year holding from the date of vest prior to release.
– Dividend equivalents are paid in cash after the vesting date.

Opportunity

– Maximum long-term incentive face value at award of 500% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 450% for other
Executive Directors.
– Threshold long-term incentive face value at award is 20% of maximum opportunity. Minimum vesting is 0% of
maximum opportunity. Awards vest on a straight-line basis between threshold and maximum.
– The Committee has the discretion to reduce long-term incentive grant levels for Directors who have neither met
their shareholding guideline nor increased their shareholding by 100% of salary during the year.
– The awards that vest accrue cash dividend equivalents over the three year vesting period.
– Awards vest to the extent performance conditions are satisfied.

Performance metrics

– Performance is measured against stretching targets set at the time of grant.
– Vesting is determined based on the following measures: adjusted free cash flow as our operational performance
measure, relative TSR against a peer group of companies as our external performance measure, ESG as a measure of
our external impact and commitment to our purpose.
– Weightings will be determined each year and will normally constitute 60% on adjusted free cash flow, 30% on
relative total shareholder return, and 10% on ESG. The Committee will determine the actual weighting of an award
prior to grant, taking into account all relevant information.

Notes to the Remuneration Policy table
Existing arrangements
We will honour existing awards, incentives, benefits and contractual arrangements made to individuals prior to their promotion to the Board
and/or prior to the approval and implementation of this policy. For the avoidance of doubt this includes payments in respect of any award granted
under any previous Remuneration Policy. This will last until the existing incentives vest (or lapse) or the benefits or contractual arrangements no
longer apply.
Long-term incentive (‘GLTI’)
When referring to our long-term incentive awards we use the financial year end in which the award was made. For example, the “2020 award”
was made in the financial year ending 31 March 2020. The awards are usually made in the first half of the financial year.
The extent to which awards vest depends on three performance conditions:
– underlying operational performance as measured by adjusted free cash flow;
– relative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) against a peer group median; and
– performance against our Environmental, Social, and Governance (‘ESG’) targets.
Adjusted free cash flow
The free cash flow performance is based on the cumulative adjusted free cash flow figure over the performance period. The detailed targets and
the definition of adjusted free cash flow are determined each year as appropriate. The target adjusted free cash flow level is set by reference to
our long-range plan and market expectations. We consider the targets to be critical to the Company’s long-term success and its ability to maximise
shareholder value, and to be in line with the strategic goals of the Company. The Remuneration Committee sets these targets to be sufficiently
demanding with significant stretch where only outstanding performance will be rewarded with a maximum payout.
The cumulative adjusted free cash flow vesting levels as a percentage of the award subject to this performance element are shown in the table
below (with linear interpolation between points):
Performance

Below threshold
Threshold
Maximum

Vesting percentage
(% of FCF element)

0%
20%
100%

TSR outperformance of a peer group median
We have a limited number of appropriate peers and this makes the measurement of a relative ranking system volatile. As such, the outperformance
of the median of a peer group is felt to be the most appropriate TSR measure. The peer group for the performance condition is reviewed each year
and amended as appropriate.
The TSR vesting levels as a percentage of the award subject to this performance element are shown in the table below (with linear interpolation
between points):
Vesting percentage
(% of TSR element)

Below median
Median
Percentage outperformance of the peer group median equivalent to 80th percentile

0%
20%
100%

In order to determine the percentages for the equivalent outperformance levels above median, the Remuneration Committee seeks independent
external advice.
ESG performance
Our ESG targets will be set on an annual basis (as per the approach for our other performance measures), and will be aligned to our externally
communicated ambitions in this area. Where performance is below the agreed ambition, the Committee will use its discretion to assess vesting
based on performance against the stated ambition and any other relevant information.
Remuneration policy for other employees
While our remuneration policy follows the same fundamental principles across the Group, packages offered to employees reflect differences in
market practice in the different countries, role and seniority.
For example, the remuneration package elements for our Executive Committee are essentially the same as for the Executive Directors with
some minor differences, for example smaller levels of share awards and local variances where appropriate. The remuneration for the next level
of management, our senior leadership team, again follows the same principles with local and individual performance aspects in the annual bonus
targets and performance share awards. They also receive lower levels of share awards which are partly delivered in conditional share awards without
performance conditions.

Base salary is at 1 July 2020.
Benefits are valued using the figures in the total remuneration for the 2020 financial year table on page 109 (of the 2020 report).

maximum performance.
The maximum award opportunity for the GSTIP is 200% of base salary.
The maximum GLTI opportunity reflects full vesting based on the maximum award levels set out in this Remuneration Policy
(i.e. 500% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 450% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer).
Long-term incentives consist of share awards only which are measured at face value i.e. no assumption for cash dividend
equivalents payable.

Note:
1. In line with UK reporting requirements, the fourth bar in each chart reflects the same assumptions as per the Maximum scenario but with an assumed share price increase of 50%
(which subsequently increases the hypothetical value of the long-term incentive under this scenario by the same percentage).

Recruitment remuneration
Our approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary and appropriate to attract the right talent to the role.
The Remuneration Policy table (pages 103 and 104) sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration
package for the appointment of an Executive Director. Any new Director’s remuneration package would include the same elements, and be subject
to the same constraints, as those of the existing Directors performing similar roles. This means a potential maximum bonus opportunity of 200% of
base salary and long-term incentive maximum face value of opportunity at award of 500% of base salary.
When considering the remuneration arrangements of individuals recruited from external roles to the Board, we will take into account the
remuneration package of that individual in their prior role. We only provide additional compensation to individuals for awards foregone. If necessary
we will seek to replicate, as far as practicable, the level and timing of such remuneration, taking into account also any remaining performance
requirements applying to it. This will be achieved by granting awards of cash or shares that vest over a timeframe similar to those forfeited and if
appropriate based on performance conditions. A commensurate reduction in quantum will be applied where it is determined that the new awards
are either not subject to performance conditions or subject to performance conditions that are not as stretching as those of the awards forfeited.

Service contracts of Executive Directors
Executive Directors’ contracts have rolling terms and are terminable on no more than 12 months’ notice.
The key elements of the service contract for executives relate to remuneration, payments on loss of office (see below), and restrictions during active
employment (and for 12 months thereafter). These restrictions include non-competition, non-solicitation of customers and employees etc.

Treatment of corporate events
All of the Company’s share plans contain provisions relating to a change of control. Outstanding awards and options would normally vest and
become exercisable on a change of control to the extent that any performance condition has been satisfied and pro-rated to reflect the acceleration
of vesting, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
In the event of a demerger, distribution (other than an ordinary dividend) or other transaction which would affect the current or future value of any
award, the Committee may allow awards to vest on the same basis as for a change of control described above. Alternatively, an adjustment may be
made to the number of shares if considered appropriate.

Payments for departing Executive Directors
In the table below we summarise the key elements of our policy on payment for loss of office. We will of course, always comply both with the
relevant plan rules and local employment legislation.
Provision

Policy

Notice period and
compensation for
loss of office in
service contracts

– 12 months’ notice from the Company to the Executive Director.
– Up to 12 months’ base salary (in line with the notice period). Notice period payments will either be made as normal
(if the executive continues to work during the notice period or is on gardening leave) or they will be made as monthly
payments in lieu of notice (subject to mitigation if alternative employment is obtained).

Treatment of annual
bonus (‘GSTIP’) on
termination under
plan rules

– The annual bonus will be pro-rated for the period of service during the financial year and will reflect the extent to which
Company performance has been achieved.
– The Remuneration Committee has discretion to reduce the entitlement to an annual bonus to reflect the individual’s
performance and the circumstances of the termination.

Treatment of unvested – An Executive Director’s award will vest in accordance with the terms of the plan and satisfaction of performance
long-term incentive
conditions measured at the normal completion of the performance period, with the award pro-rated for the proportion
awards (‘GLTI’)
of the vesting period that had elapsed at the date of cessation of employment.
on termination
– The Remuneration Committee has discretion to vary the level of vesting as deemed appropriate, and in particular to
under plan rules
determine that awards should not vest for reasons which may include, at their absolute discretion, departure in case of
poor performance, departure without the agreement of the Board, or detrimental competitive activity.
Pension and benefits

– Generally pension and benefit provisions will continue to apply until the termination date.
– Where appropriate other benefits may be receivable, such as (but not limited to) payments in lieu of accrued holiday
and legal fees or tax advice costs in relation to the termination.
– Benefits of relative small value may continue after termination where appropriate, such as (but not limited to) mobile
phone provision.

In exceptional circumstances, an arrangement may be established specifically to facilitate the exit of a particular individual albeit that any such
arrangement would be made within the context of minimising the cost to the Group. We will only take such a course of action in exceptional
circumstances and where it is considered to be in the best interests of shareholders.

Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration
Our policy is for the Chairman to review the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors annually following consultation with the Remuneration
Committee Chairman. Fees for the Chairman are set by the Remuneration Committee.
Element

Policy

Fees

– We aim to pay competitively for the role including consideration of the time commitment required. We benchmark the fees
against an appropriate external comparator group. We pay a fee to our Chairman which includes fees for chairmanship of
any committees. We pay a fee to each of our other Non-Executive Directors and they receive an additional fee if they chair a
committee and/or hold the position of Senior Independent Director. Non-executive fee levels are set within the maximum level
as approved by shareholders as part of our Articles of Association. We review the structure of fees from time to time and may, as
appropriate, make changes to the manner in which total fees are structured, including but not limited to any additional chair or
membership fees.

Allowances

– Under a legacy arrangement, an allowance is payable each time certain non-Europe-based Non-Executive Directors are
required to travel to attend Board and committee meetings to reflect the additional time commitment involved.

Incentives

– Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any incentive plans.

Benefits

– Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any benefit plans. The Company does not provide any contribution to their
pension arrangements. The Chairman is entitled to the use of a car and a driver whenever and wherever he is providing
his services to or representing the Company. We have been advised that for Non-Executive Directors, certain travel and
accommodation expenses in relation to attending Board meetings should be treated as a taxable benefit therefore we also
cover the tax liability for these expenses.

Non-Executive Director letters of appointment
Non-Executive Directors are engaged on letters of appointment that set out their duties and responsibilities. The appointment of Non-Executive
Directors may be terminated without compensation. Non-Executive Directors are generally not expected to serve for a period exceeding nine years.
For further information refer to the Nominations and Governance Committee section of the Annual Report.

Annual Report on Remuneration
Remuneration Committee
In this section we give details of the composition of the Remuneration Committee and activities undertaken during the 2021 financial year.
The Committee’s function is to exercise independent judgement and consists only of the following independent Non-Executive Directors:
Chairman: Valerie Gooding
Committee members: Michel Demaré, Dame Clara Furse and Renee James
The Committee regularly consults with Nick Read, the Chief Executive, and Leanne Wood, the Chief Human Resources Officer, on various matters
relating to the appropriateness of awards for Executive Directors and senior executives, though they are not present when their own compensation is
discussed. In addition, Adrian Jackson, the Group Reward and Policy Director, provides a perspective on information provided to the Committee, and
requests information and analysis from external advisers as required. Rosemary Martin, the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, advises
the Committee on corporate governance guidelines and is Secretary to the Committee.
External advisers
The Remuneration Committee seeks and considers advice from independent remuneration advisers where appropriate. The appointed advisers, Willis
Towers Watson, were selected following a thorough process led by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee at the time and were appointed by
the Committee in 2007. The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee has direct access to the advisers as and when required, and the Committee
determines the protocols by which the advisers interact with management in support of the Committee. The advice and recommendations of the
external advisers are used as a guide, but do not serve as a substitute for thorough consideration of the issues by each Committee member. Advisers
attend Committee meetings occasionally, as and when required by the Committee.
Willis Towers Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Remuneration Consultants’
Group Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. This is based upon principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity,
competence, due care and confidentiality by executive remuneration consultants. Willis Towers Watson has confirmed that it adheres to that Code of
Conduct throughout the year for all remuneration services provided to Vodafone and therefore the Committee is satisfied that it is independent and
objective. The Remuneration Consultants’ Group Code of Conduct is available at remunerationconsultantsgroup.com.

2021 remuneration
In this section we summarise the pay packages awarded to our Executive Directors for performance in the 2021 financial year versus 2020. Specifically
we have provided a table that shows all remuneration that was earned by each individual during the year and computed a single total remuneration
figure for the year. The value of the annual bonus (‘GSTIP’) reflects what was earned in respect of the year but will be paid out in cash in the following
year. Similarly the value of the long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) reflects the share awards which will vest in June 2021 as a result of the performance through
the three-year period ended at the completion of our financial year on 31 March 2021.
Consideration of the use of discretion
The Remuneration Committee reviews all incentive awards prior to payment and uses judgement to ensure that the final assessments of performance
are fair and appropriate. If circumstances warrant it, the Committee may adjust the final payment or vesting downwards.
The Committee reviewed incentive outcomes at the May 2021 meeting and determined them to be appropriate in light of business performance
across the relevant performance periods. The Committee agreed that the business had remained resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic, noting
how the business had responded in an agile and effective manner during the year under review. In particular the Committee noted that no employees
had been furloughed (either in the year under review, or the prior year), the business was continuing to maintain a dividend, and wider employee pay
reviews, including the delivery of performance-related pay, had been carried out in both years of the pandemic. It was subsequently agreed that no
adjustments were required to either the short-term or long-term incentive outcomes this year.

Notes:
1. Taxable benefits include amounts in respect of: – Private healthcare (2021: Nick Read £2,683, Margherita Della Valle £2,153; 2020: £2,583 for both Executive Directors);
– Cash car allowance £19,200 p.a.; and
– Travel (2021: Nick Read £10,114, Margherita Della Valle £nil; 2020: Nick Read £19,759, Margherita Della Valle £325).
2. The share prices used for both the 2021 and 2020 values, as set out in note 3 below, are lower than the grant prices for both respective awards. As such, no amount of the values shown in either
column are attributable to share price appreciation during the performance or vesting periods.
3. The value shown in the 2020 column is the award which vested on 4 August 2020 in respect of Nick Read and 26 June 2020 in respect of Margherita Della Valle, and is valued using the respective
execution share prices on 4 August 2020 of 118.02 pence and on 26 June 2020 of 127.28 pence. The value shown in the 2020 column for Margherita Della Valle reflects the vesting of a share award
granted in June 2017 prior to her appointment to the Board. The value shown in the 2021 column is the award which vests on 26 June 2021 and is valued using an average closing share price over
the last quarter of the 2021 financial year of 129.73 pence.
4. Nick Read and Margherita Della Valle receive a cash award equivalent in value to the dividends that would have been paid during the vesting period on any shares that vest. The dividend value shown
in 2021 relates to awards vesting on 26 June 2021. The value in the 2020 column for Margherita Della Vale reflects the value of dividend equivalent shares accrued during the performance period in
respect of the award which vested on 26 June 2020 (which was granted prior to her appointment to the Board).
5. Reflects the value of the SAYE benefit which is calculated as £375 x 12 months x 20% to reflect the discount applied based on savings made during the year.

2021 annual bonus (‘GSTIP’) payout (audited)
In the table below we disclose our achievement against each of the performance measures and targets in our annual bonus (‘GSTIP’) and the resulting
total annual bonus payout level for the year ended 31 March 2021 of 62.0% of maximum. This is applied to the maximum bonus level of 200% of base
salary for each executive. Commentary on our performance against each measure is provided below the table.

Annual Report on Remuneration (continued)
Financial metrics
As set out in the table above, free cash flow and EBIT finished above the midpoints of the respective target ranges reflecting strong performance in
markets including Germany, Spain, Turkey and South Africa.
Customer appreciation KPIs
An assessment of performance under the customer appreciation KPIs measure was conducted on a market by market basis. Each market was assessed
against a number of different metrics which included:
– Churn is defined as total gross customer disconnections in the period divided by the average total customers in the period.
– Revenue market share is based on our total service revenue and that of our competitors in the markets we operate in.
– Net Promoter Score (‘NPS’) for both Consumer and Vodafone Business – defined as the extent to which our customers would recommend us.
All measures utilise data from our local markets which is collected and validated for quality and consistency by independent third-party agencies
where possible.
Our overall customer appreciation KPI outcome reflects good performance during the year including in a number of our largest markets (most notably
Germany and the UK). Further details on performance against each key metric are set out below. The Committee agreed that a final payout slightly
above the mid-point of the target range was appropriate for this measure.
In respect of churn, the business recorded very strong Group results with year-on-year underlying performance also showing an improvement. Such
improvement was primarily driven by strong performance in Germany and the UK. Italy and Spain also finished the year off well despite increased
competition in these markets.
Revenue market share in our four largest European markets improved slightly during the year with the increases recorded in Germany and the UK
offset by less favourable performance in Spain and Italy. The gap to the market leader reduced in all four of these markets, with the UK also improving
its position to joint second. Our market position in Germany and Spain remained stable whilst our position in Italy fell.
Elsewhere in the business performance was mixed with a number of markets gaining market share and reducing the gap to the leader (with Portugal
improving in both of these areas) albeit a number of others, including Turkey, recording a fall in market share and a widening in the gap to the market
leader. Market position across these operations remained stable with the exception of Romania where we improved our position to second.
Consumer NPS performance during the year saw us becoming the new market leader or co-leader in Germany and Italy, with the UK also moving into
second place in the market for the first time. In Turkey we closed the gap to our competitors (albeit in the context of declining NPS scores across all
local competitors) whilst in South Africa increased pressure saw us move from outright leader to co-leader in this market.
Business NPS performance remained strong during the year and we continue to hold leadership or co-leadership positions in the large majority of our
markets including Italy, Spain and South Africa. In Spain we became the market leader for the first time in four years following a significant improvement
against our competition, whilst in Germany and Turkey we retained second place whilst also reducing the gap to our competitors. During the year the
UK lost its co-leadership position in what is an extremely close and competitive market.
It is within this context that overall performance against our customer appreciation KPIs metrics during the year was judged to be above the mid-point
of the target range. The aggregated performance for the Group is calculated on a revenue-weighted average to give an overall achievement. The overall
Group achievement for the year was 60.4% which reflects consistently good performance across our largest markets in both Europe and Africa.

Long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) award vesting in June 2021 (audited)
Vesting outcome
The 2019 long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) awards which were made to executives in June 2018 will vest at 22.4% of maximum in June 2021. The performance
conditions for the three-year period ending in the 2021 financial year are as follows:

The adjusted free cash flow for the three-year period ended on
31 March 2021 was €16.5 billion and equates to vesting under the
FCF element of 33.6% of maximum.
The chart to the right shows that our TSR performance over the
three-year period ended on 31 March 2021 was below that of the
median of our comparator group resulting in no vesting under the
TSR element.
When the weighting of each condition is applied to the respective
performance outcomes, this results in a calculated payout of 22.4%
of overall maximum.
The vesting impact of this outcome when applied to the number of
shares granted is set out in the table below.

Specified procedures are performed by our internal audit team over the adjusted free cash flow to assist with the Committee’s assessment of performance.
The performance assessment in respect of the TSR measure is undertaken by Willis Towers Watson. Details of how the plan works can be found in the
Remuneration Policy.
Long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) awarded during the year (audited)
As set out in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report, due to the exceptional market conditions created by COVID-19, the Committee agreed to delay
the grant of the 2021 award, including any decision on the exact weightings of the performance measures, until November 2020.
The Committee met shortly prior to the grant to agree the details of the November 2020 award. During its discussion the Committee agreed that
the business had continued to show resilience despite COVID-19 as illustrated through how no employees had been furloughed, the business had
continued to pay a dividend and the share price was stable.
The Committee therefore agreed it was appropriate to grant the 2021 award in line with what had been communicated as the normal policy
approach and approved by shareholders as part of the Policy Report at the July 2020 AGM. This included balancing the performance conditions in
line with the expected normal weightings (as set out below), granting awards in line with the newly reduced maximum opportunity levels for both
Executive Directors, and calculating awards using the closing share price of the day immediately prior to grant, as per the Committee’s normal approach.
The independent performance conditions for the 2021 long-term incentive awards made in November 2020, and subject to a three-year performance
period ending 31 March 2023, are adjusted free cash flow (60% of total award), relative TSR (30% of total award) and ESG (10% of total award)

Outstanding awards
The structure for awards made in June 2019 (vesting June 2022) and November 2020 (vesting August 2023) is set out on the previous page.
Further details on the structure of these awards, and relevant targets, can be found in the Annual Report on Remuneration of the relevant year.
All-employee share plans
During the year the Executive Directors were eligible to participate in the Vodafone Group Sharesave Plan which is open to all UK employees.
The Vodafone Sharesave Plan is an HM Revenue & Customs (‘HMRC’) approved scheme open to all staff permanently employed by a Vodafone
company in the UK as of the eligibility date. Options under the plan are granted at up to a 20% discount to market value. Executive Directors’
participation is included in the option table on page 96.
Pensions (audited)
During the 2021 financial year Nick Read received a cash allowance of 10% of base salary. Margherita Della Valle accrued benefits under the defined
contribution pension plan of £3,999.96 with the remainder of her 10% of base salary pension benefit for the year delivered as a cash allowance.
Nick Read is a deferred member of the Vodafone Group Pension Scheme which closed to future accrual in 2010 before he was an Executive Director.
Margherita Della Valle has not participated in a Vodafone sponsored defined benefit scheme during her employment.
The Executive Directors are provided benefits in the event of death in service. In the event of ill health, an entitlement to benefit of 2/3 of base salary,
up to a maximum benefit determined by the insurer, may be provided up until State Pension Age. In respect of the Executive Committee members,
the Group has made aggregate contributions of £194,955 (2020: £273,771) into defined contribution pension schemes.
Alignment to shareholder interests (audited)
Current levels of ownership by the Executive Directors, and the date by which the goal should be or should have been achieved, are shown below.
Based on a share price of 129.73 pence, Nick Read is currently above, and Margherita Della Valle currently below, the respective shareholding
requirement. As shown in the charts below, both Executive Directors increased their shareholding levels during the year. Margherita Della Valle joined
the Board on 27 July 2018 and will continue to work towards achieving her goal prior to July 2023.

The shareholding requirements include a post employment condition whereby the Executive Directors will need to continue to hold shares equivalent
to the value of their requirement at the date of departure (or actual holding on departure if the requirement has not been reached during employment)
for a further two years post employment. The Committee has a number of processes in place to ensure this condition is met, including executives
agreeing to these terms prior to receiving an award, executives holding the majority of their shares (and at least up to the value of their requirement)
in a nominee rather than a personal account, and the Committee having the ability to lapse any unvested GLTI awards if the condition is not met.
Collectively the Executive Committee including the Executive Directors owned 24,478,674 Vodafone shares at 31 March 2021, with a value of over
£31.7 million. None of the Executive Committee members’ shareholdings amounts to more than 1% of the issued shares in that class of share,
excluding treasury shares.
Directors’ interests in the shares of the Company (audited)
A summary of interests in shares and scheme interests of the Directors who served during the year is given below. More details of the outstanding
shares subject to award and options are set out in the table below and on page 96.

Committee was informed that Vittorio Colao (who retired from the Board on 30 September 2018) had been appointed as Minister for Technological
Innovation and Digital Transition within the Italian government. In order to avoid any conflicts of interest, Mr Colao was required to sell his shareholding
in Vodafone Group Plc. This included 122,075 vested shares due to be released on 1 July 2021 and a further 141,799 vested shares due to be released
on 4 August 2022. In light of the circumstances, the Committee agreed to release these shares from their respective holding periods early in order to
allow Mr Colao to meet the compliance requirements of his new role.

Pay in the wider context
Fair pay at Vodafone
As part of its review of executive remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes account of the pay policies in place across the wider business. This
includes considering the structure of remuneration offerings at each level of the business to ensure there is a strong rationale for how packages evolve
across the different levels of the organisation.
During the year the Committee was updated on how a revised remuneration structure had been implemented across the business to ensure
arrangements fully aligned with our strategy, supported our purpose, and celebrated our spirit. The update also set out the growing use of our digital
recognition tools across the business including our peer to peer ‘Thank You’ awards and instant ‘Vodafone Star’ cash awards – the latter of which are
primarily focused on rewarding our non-management colleagues. The Committee was also updated on the results of the latest annual fair pay review,
including where the key focus areas were and what actions had been agreed locally to implement any required adjustments. In addition to being a core
principle of the Committee, there is a clear culture in our business of ensuring we offer competitive and fair pay to all employees. Our approach, across
our business, is guided by the following six principles:
1. Market competitive
The pay of our people is reflective of their skills, role and function and the external market.
We annually review the pay of each employee and actively manage any who fall below the market competitive range.
2. Free from discrimination
Our pay should not be affected by gender, age, disability, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, cultural heritage or belief.
We annually compare the average position of our men and women against their market benchmark, grade and function to identify and understand any
differences, and take action if necessary.
3. Ensure a good standard of living
We work with the independent organisation, the Fair Wage Network, to assess how our pay compares to the “living wage” in each of our markets
because we are committed to providing a good standard of living for our people and their family.
4. Share in our successes
All our people should have the opportunity to share in our success by being eligible to receive some form of performance related pay, e.g. a bonus,
shares or sales incentive.
5. Provide benefits for all
Our global standard is to offer all our people life insurance, parental leave and access to either Company or state provided healthcare and
pension provision.
6. Open and transparent
We ensure that our people understand their pay. We do this through a series of user-friendly guides, webpages and an annual reward statement,
which help explain our peoples’ pay and outline the value of their core reward package.
In addition, they also receive monthly or weekly payslips and a payment schedule.

vodafone.com/fair-pay
Stakeholder engagement
The Committee considers all stakeholder groups when setting executive pay including:
Colleagues
The Committee is fully briefed on pay arrangements across the business to ensure any decisions on executive pay are made within our wider business
context. We engage with our employees through a variety of means including employee forums, town hall meetings (including with our executives),
global Spirit Beat surveys and digital platforms – all of which give our people the chance to voice their opinion on any area of interest – including
executive pay.
Shareholders
The Committee values the active participation of our shareholders during our consultations and fully considers all feedback as part of the review
process. Last year we started our consultation in November 2019 (for the July 2020 AGM) to ensure all parties had adequate time for engagement.
Government
The Committee actively engages with external professional bodies/government departments when they issue consultations on proposed changes to
legislation/reporting guidelines.
Wider society
The Committee is fully aware that society has grown increasingly concerned about executive pay in the wider market. The Committee believes that
through transparent reporting and active engagement in explaining both the operation of, and rationale for, executive pay decisions, trust in this area
can be rebuilt.

UK Gender Pay Gap reporting
Each year we publish our UK Gender Pay Gap in line with the statutory UK methodology. The nature of the statutory calculation means the gap will
fluctuate year on year, influenced by changes in our business structure, Company performance and the percentage of men and women at all levels and
positions. The existence of a UK gender pay gap in our business is primarily a consequence of more men than women holding senior or specialist, and
therefore higher-paid, roles.
With our commitment to embed an inclusive culture, we continue our work to reduce the gap and have made good progress since the publication of
the first report in 2017. Our global programmes aim to support all women across different roles, areas, and geographies of our business and will, over
time, reduce our specific UK Gender Pay Gap (which this year was calculated as 12.0% – a slight increase from our 2019 figure of 10.9% but below our
2018 figure of 16.1%). While we have made progress, we are committed to doing more.

The calculation methodology used reflects Option B as defined under the relevant regulations. In line with the relevant regulations this utilises the most
recently collected and disclosed data analysed within our Gender Pay Gap report, with employees at the three quartiles identified from this analysis and
their respective single figure values calculated.
To ensure this data accurately reflects individuals at such quartiles, the single figure values for individuals immediately above and below the identified
employee at each quartile within the Gender Pay Gap analysis were also reviewed.
This year our ratios have remained relatively stable when viewed on a year-on-year basis. This reflects how the single figures for both the Chief Executive
and employees at the quartile positions have remained consistent when viewed over the period set out in the table above. We expect the ratios to be
primarily driven by the valuation of the long-term incentive that is included in the Chief Executive’s single figure for the year.

Change in remuneration for Directors and all employees between 2020 and 2021
In line with the new regulatory requirements, the table below calculates the percentage change in Directors’ remuneration (salary, taxable benefits and
annual bonus payment) between the 2020 and 2021 financial years compared to the average remuneration for other Vodafone Group employees
who are measured on comparable business objectives and who have been employed in the UK since 2021 (per capita). Vodafone has employees
based all around the world and some of these individuals work in countries with very high inflation; therefore a comparison to Vodafone’s UK-based
Group employees is deemed the most appropriate employee group for this comparison.

In the table below we summarise the Chief Executive’s single figure remuneration over the past 10 years, as well as how our variable pay plans have
paid out in relation to the maximum opportunity. This can be compared with the historic TSR performance over the same period. The chart below
shows the performance of the Company relative to the STOXX Europe 600 Index over a 10-year period. The STOXX Europe 600 Index was selected
as this is a broad-based index that includes many of our closest competitors. It should be noted that the TSR element of the 2019 GLTI is based on

2022 remuneration
Details of how the Remuneration Policy will be implemented for the 2022 financial year are set out below.
Prior to reviewing executive remuneration arrangements the Committee was fully briefed on remuneration arrangements elsewhere in the business.
This included a detailed discussion on the structure of remuneration offerings at each level of the business and how pay at these levels is determined.
The Committee also considered the wider external context in light of the developing COVID-19 situation, and the commitments made to our wider
employee population.
The cumulative effect of these discussions was that the Committee was able to make decisions in respect of executive remuneration within the context
of how, and appreciating the rationale for why, remuneration arrangements evolve across the different levels within the organisation.2021
2022 Base salaries
In March 2021 the Committee reviewed executive remuneration arrangements against the following comparator groups:
1. A EuroTop peer group constituting the top 50 European companies (excluding financial services companies) and a few other select companies
relevant to the telco sector; and
2. The FTSE 30 (excluding financial services companies).
As set out on page 82 in the Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman, neither the Chief Executive nor the Chief Financial Officer have
received a salary increase since their appointment to their current roles in 2018. In the light of their strong performance and growing experience in
role the Committee agreed an increase would be justified. However, in line with the restraint on salary increases for the wider leadership team, the
Committee felt that salaries for both Executive Directors should remain unchanged for the year ahead at the current levels of:
– Chief Executive: Nick Read £1,050,000; and
– Chief Financial Officer: Margherita Della Valle £700,000.
The Committee acknowledges the importance of our arrangements remaining fair and competitive and will review this situation again next year.
The Committee further determined that salaries for Executive Committee members will also remain unchanged.
Pension
Pension arrangements for both the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer will remain unchanged at 10% of salary, in line with the maximum
employer contribution level for the wider UK population.
2022 Annual Bonus (‘GSTIP’)
In light of the uncertainty caused by COVID-19 and the subsequent difficulty to set an accurate one-year service revenue target for the 2021 financial
year, the decision was taken to remove the service revenue condition from the 2021 plan and retain the remaining three measures.
As set out on page 82 of the Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman, for the 2022 plan the Committee has agreed to re-introduce service
revenue given the strategic importance of growth to our business and our ability to now accurately forecast an appropriate target.
The performance measures and weightings for 2022, are outlined below:
–
–
–
–

service revenue (25%);
adjusted EBIT (25%);
adjusted free cash flow (25%); and
customer appreciation KPIs (25%). This includes an assessment of churn, revenue market share and Net Promoter Score1 (‘NPS’).

Note:
1. The assessment of NPS utilises data collected in our local markets which is validated for quality and consistency by independent third party agencies.

Due to the potential impact on our commercial interests, annual bonus targets are considered commercially sensitive and therefore will be disclosed
in the 2022 Remuneration Report following the completion of the financial year.
Long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) awards for 2022
Awards for 2022 will be made in line with the arrangements described in our policy on pages 86 and 87. Vesting of the 2022 award will be subject
to adjusted free cash flow (60% of total award), relative TSR (30% of total award), and ESG (10% of total award) performance. Performance will be
measured over the three financial years ending 31 March 2024, and any net vested shares will be subject to an additional two-year holding period
(i.e. the ‘3+2’ model). It is anticipated that the final awards will be reviewed by the Committee at the July 2021 meeting and, subject to the Committee’s
approval, will be granted shortly after in August 2021.

Relative TSR (30% of total award)
Following the annual review of the performance measures which included a review of analysis provided by the Committee’s external advisers,
the Committee determined that the TSR outperformance range for the 2022 award should continue to be set at the 80th percentile equivalent
for maximum performance. For the 2022 award, this equates to outperformance of 8.50% p.a. at maximum.
The Committee further determined that the TSR peer group should remain unchanged for the 2022 award. Further details are set out in the
tables below.

Each ambition for the 2022 award has been set by considering both our externally communicated targets and our internal progress as at 31 March 2021.
Where we are ahead of our originally communicated external ambition we have set our target recognising this so as to ensure all ambitions remain
stretching against actual current performance.
At the end of the performance period the Committee will assess achievement across the three metrics against the stated ambitions and determine
vesting under this element. Full disclosure of the rationale for the final vesting decision will be provided in the relevant Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Further remuneration information
Dilution
All awards are made under plans that incorporate dilution limits as set out in the guidelines for share incentive schemes published by the
Investment Association. The current estimated dilution from subsisting executive awards is approximately 2.6% of the Company’s share capital at
31 March 2021 (2.6% at 31 March 2020), whilst from all-employee share awards it is approximately 0.3% (0.3% at 31 March 2020). This gives a total
dilution of 2.9% (2.9% at 31 March 2020).
Service contracts
The terms and conditions of appointment of our Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal business hours
and at the Annual General Meeting (for 15 minutes prior to the meeting and during the meeting). The Executive Directors have notice periods in their
service contracts of 12 months. The Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment do not contain provision for notice periods or for compensation if
their appointments are terminated.
This report on remuneration has been approved by the Board of Directors and signed on its behalf by:
